\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}

Objectives of the report:
- Outline (in some detail) the problem faced by high-traffic internet services when providing data to a lot of different people

- Be more specific to the problem we face (mobile social networking application, location-based data retrieval)

- Cover some of the general guidelines to solving these kinds of problems

- Describe scenarios which we are likely to encounter

- Describe and implement a possible solution to the problem

- Test the proposed solution against the scenarios we devised

- Discuss the performance of the solution we have proposed and comment upon aspects in which it has been successful and aspects in which it has been a failure

- Based on the performance of the solution, suggest other solutions (or at least solution details) that we may be able to explore to address shortcomings of the proposed solution

\section{Background and Content} % (fold)
\label{sec:background_and_content}

\textbf{TODO: Should probably include some related work here}

\textbf{Context}

- Social media applications are become integrated within our daily lives

- Effective means of communication and information discovery

- Most of them are free...users like free stuff!

- Mobile applications enable users to be out and about while surfing the web, something that wasn't really possible previously

- There is stuff to do when users are out and about, which social media apps can enhance

\textbf{Motivation}

- Some social media apps are super rich in content and have a substantial base of users

- This is a great thing, but somewhere this data needs to be stored (huge amounts of data!)

- Additionally, not every user is going to want every bit of data

- A search for personalised data (i.e. data that an individual user cares about) at a large-scale can be computationally expensive and slow (users don't like to wait!)

- Caching alleviates this problem to some extent (allows computations to occur a smaller number of times, with the results stored -- caching tier is much lower latency than the datastore)

- Problem is, that this doesn't come cheap

- Cached data is not persistent (caching tier is separate from DB)

- Need to ensure cache is not invalid (we need to provide users with the data they want)

- As the number of users increases, it becomes less practical to provide high-availability/throughput personalized information

- We need to make trade-offs, based on the problem space (no of users, user usage patterns, distribution of data -- location-based)

\section{Technical Detail} % (fold)
\label{sec:technical_detail}

Need code snippets for:

- Model objects (what we're sorting into buckets)

- Public bucket sorting algorithm
