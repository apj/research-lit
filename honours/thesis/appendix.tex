The data referred to in the study of change (\chapref{Findings}) is  described in \tabref{change_files}, and located in the directory \texttt{data/change} on the DVD. The data is also available online at:

The raw metric data is provided as a comma separated values (CSV) file, and the first line of the file contains the header. A detailed output of the statistical analysis undertaken is provided as log files generated directly from Stata (a statistical analysis software) \cite{Stata09a}.

The data table (\tabref{change_files}) is on the next page.
