\chapter{Vocabulary Analysis Files} % (fold)
\label{cha:vocabulary_analysis_files}

The data referred to in the study of vocabulary (\chapref{findings}) is described in \tabref{analysis_files}, and located in the directory \texttt{data} on the DVD. The data is also available online at:

The raw metric data is provided as comma separated values (CSV) files, and the first line of the file contains the header.

The data table (\tabref{analysis_files}) is on the next page.

\chapter{Vocabulary Analysis Reports} % (fold)
\label{cha:vocabulary_analysis_reports}

The data used in this thesis was collected via an extension developed for the Mutations software evolution tool. Mutations consists of the following modules:

\textbf{Metric Extractor:} Extracts the metric data from Java class files for each version of the system and stores them in plain-text (JSON format).

\textbf{Report Generator:} Generates statistical reports using the extracted metric data.

As part of this research effort, we extended the \emph{Report Generator} module to allow the generation of statistical reports for the analysis of vocabulary.

The reports developed for Mutations and used to generate the statistics for the study of vocabulary (\chapref{findings}) are described in \tabref{vocabulary_reports}, and located in the directory \texttt{mutations} on the DVD. The source code is also available online at:

{\bf Report} & {\bf \#} & {\bf Description} \\
\hline \hline 
\texttt{Vocabulary Growth} & 201 & Produces the evolution of vocabulary size \\
\hline
\texttt{Term Frequency} & 202 & Produces the frequency distribution of term usage for each version \\
\hline
\texttt{Term Gini} & 203 & Produces the evolution of the Gini Coefficient of terms in the vocabulary used to identify changes in distribution \\
\hline
\texttt{Term Frequency} \par \texttt{vs. Age} & 204 & Produces the age of a term and the frequency of its usage based on the release in which it was introduced \\
\hline
\texttt{Popular Terms} & 205 & Produces a list of the most popular terms within the vocabulary \\
\hline
\texttt{Popular Term} \par \texttt{History} & 206 & Produces the usage history of terms in the vocabulary, sorted by popularity \\
