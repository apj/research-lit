\section{Growth in Vocabulary} % (fold)
\label{sec:growth_in_vocabulary}

We investigate growth by analysing the total token count for the system and how it changes over time (growth charts)

\textbf{Comment on the general trends for systems in terms of growth}

\textbf{Point out any abnormalities in terms of growth late in the development}

\textbf{Speculate as to why these abnormalities have arisen ... are they common? Major releases?}

\textbf{Need some examples where growth is prominent -- outline what we think it causing the growth here}

\textbf{Where there is a noticeably large amount of growth, what is contributing to the growth? Is there much there that would need documentation}

\textbf{Note that some of the popular terms do not even exist in the first version}

% section growth_in_vocabulary (end)

\section{Rich Terms} % (fold)
\label{sec:rich_terms}

\textbf{How do rich terms evolve over time?}

\textbf{Most of the rich terms start relatively rich and get richer}

\textbf{Some terms start rich and don't get richer}

\textbf{Some terms start poor and get substantially richer}

\textbf{A small amount of terms lose wealth}

% section rich_terms (end)

% \section{Stability of the Vocabulary} % (fold)
% \label{sec:stability_of_the_vocabulary}
% 
% \textbf{What is the nature of change for the vocabulary?}
% \textbf{What is the likelihood of change in the vocabulary and how significant is the change from release to release}
% 
% % section stability_of_the_vocabulary (end)

% \section{Term Re-Use} % (fold)
% \label{sec:term_re_use}
% 
% \textbf{Popular terms being continually re-used}
% \textbf{Existing terms being applied to new classes/modules -- do an investigation to find out what they are being used for -- these sorts of terms are more representative of a common vocab, rather than describing domain concepts}
% 
% % section term_re_use (end)

\section{Distribution of Term Usage} % (fold)
\label{sec:distribution_of_term_usage}

\textbf{How does the distribution start}

\textbf{How does it change?}

\textbf{Increasing number of terms are beyond our max threshold, but there is a big gap in the middle with very small number of tokens accounting for those occurrence counts}

% section distribution_of_term_usage (end)

% \section{New Concepts} % (fold)
% \label{sec:new_concepts}
% 
% \textbf{Some terms are being introduced at later stage with a large number of occurrences}
% 
% % section new_concepts (end)

% \section{Term Volatility} % (fold)
% \label{sec:term_volatility}
% 
% \textbf{Point out any atypical growth patterns/changes in usage of terms -- e.g. terms that start out with small no. of occurrences and increase at regular intervals, terms that decrease in usage or ceased to be used at all, terms that exhibit burst in growth across particular versions}
% 
% % section term_volatility (end)

\section{Laws of Software Evolution} % (fold)
\label{sec:laws_of_software_evolution}

\textbf{Use our findings to assess the applicability of Lehman's laws...can refer to notes on this from weekly meetings in May}

\subsection{Continuing Change} % (fold)
\label{sub:continuing_change}

\textbf{Gini value continues to increase over time, so does frequency distribution}

\textbf{What is causing this?}

\textbf{What are the implications of this?}

% subsection continuing_change (end)

\subsection{Increasing Complexity} % (fold)
\label{sub:increasing_complexity}

\textbf{Show context of top terms}
\textbf{Is there an indication there may be a strategy to manage vocabulary?}

% subsection increasing_complexity (end)

\subsection{Self Regulation} % (fold)
\label{sub:self_regulation}

\textbf{Seems to be contained -- is it sufficient? How can we gauge this?}

% subsection self_regulation (end)

\subsection{Conservation of Stability} % (fold)
\label{sub:conservation_of_stability}

\textbf{Refer to b-metric values}

\textbf{How stable is it and why is it stable? -- distribution is staying the same}

% subsection conservation_of_stability (end)

\subsection{Conservation of Familiarity} % (fold)
\label{sub:conservation_of_familiarity}

\textbf{Gini values continuing up...popular terms are becoming even more popular}

% subsection conservation_of_familiarity (end)

\subsection{Continuing Growth} % (fold)
\label{sub:continuing_growth}

\textbf{Continually growing, though in almost all cases the growth is sub-linear}

% subsection continuing_growth (end)

\subsection{Declining Quality} % (fold)
\label{sub:declining_quality}

\textbf{N/A}

% subsection declining_quality (end)

\subsection{Feedback System} % (fold)
\label{sub:feedback_system}
