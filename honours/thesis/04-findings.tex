\section{Growth in Vocabulary} % (fold)
\label{sec:growth_in_vocabulary}

We investigate growth by analysing the total token count for the system and how it changes over time (growth charts)

\textbf{Need some examples where growth is prominent -- outline what we think it causing the growth here}

\textbf{How does the vocabulary grow -- what attributes to increases in growth count? Are many new concepts (words with significant no. of occurrences) introduced in later stages or is it just 1s and 2s?}

\textbf{Note that some of the popular terms do not even exist in the first version}

% section growth_in_vocabulary (end)

% \section{Stability of the Vocabulary} % (fold)
% \label{sec:stability_of_the_vocabulary}
% 
% \textbf{What is the nature of change for the vocabulary?}
% \textbf{What is the likelihood of change in the vocabulary and how significant is the change from release to release}
% 
% % section stability_of_the_vocabulary (end)

% \section{Term Re-Use} % (fold)
% \label{sec:term_re_use}
% 
% \textbf{Popular terms being continually re-used}
% \textbf{Existing terms being applied to new classes/modules -- do an investigation to find out what they are being used for -- these sorts of terms are more representative of a common vocab, rather than describing domain concepts}
%

\section{Distribution of Term Usage} % (fold)
\label{sec:distribution_of_term_usage}

\textbf{Rich terms vs. poor terms...what kind of terms are typically rich?}

\textbf{How does this change over time...do rich terms get richer/stay rich/become relatively less rich?}

% section distribution_of_term_usage (end)

% \section{New Concepts} % (fold)
% \label{sec:new_concepts}
% 
% \textbf{Some terms are being introduced at later stage with a large number of occurrences}
% 
% % section new_concepts (end)

% \section{Term Volatility} % (fold)
% \label{sec:term_volatility}
% 
% \textbf{Point out any atypical growth patterns/changes in usage of terms -- e.g. terms that start out with small no. of occurrences and increase at regular intervals, terms that decrease in usage or ceased to be used at all, terms that exhibit burst in growth across particular versions}

\section{Laws of Software Evolution} % (fold)
\label{sec:laws_of_software_evolution}

\textbf{Use our findings to assess the applicability of Lehman's laws...can refer to notes on this from weekly meetings in May}
