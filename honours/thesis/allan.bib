@article{Paulson04a,
	Abstract = {This paper describes an empirical study of open-source and closed-source
	software projects. The motivation for this research is to quantitatively
	investigate common perceptions about open-source projects, and to
	validate these perceptions through an empirical study. This paper
	investigates the hypothesis that open-source software grows more
	quickly, but does not find evidence to support this. The project
	growth is similar for all the projects in the analysis, indicating
	that other factors may limit growth. The hypothesis that creativity
	is more prevalent in open-source software is also examined, and evidence
	to support this hypothesis is found using the metric of functions
	added over time. The concept of open-source projects succeeding because
	of their simplicity is not supported by the analysis, nor is the
	hypothesis of open-source projects being more modular. However, the
	belief that defects are found and fixed more rapidly in open-source
	projects is supported by an analysis of the functions modified. The
	paper finds support for two of the five common beliefs and concludes
	that, when implementing or switching to the open-source development
	model, practitioners should ensure that an appropriate metrics collection
	strategy is in place to verify the perceived benefits.},

@inproceedings{Mens08a,
	Abstract = {We present a metrics-based study of the evolution of Eclipse, an open
	source integrated development environment, based on data from seven
	major releases, from releases 1.0 to 3.3. We investigated whether
	three of the laws of software evolution were supported by the data.
	We found that Eclipse displayed continual change and growth, hence
	supporting laws 1 and 6. Six size indicators, out of eight, closely
	followed trend models. Four were linear and two superlinear. We found
	evidence of increasing complexity (law 2) in only two indicators,
	out of five. At subproject level, size and complexity are not distributed
	uniformly, and subproject size can be modelled as a negative exponential
	function of the rank position. We encountered a range of different
	size and complexity trends across subprojects. Our approach and results
	can help in evaluating the future evolution of Eclipse, the evolution
	of other systems and in performing comparisons.},
